# Tic-Tac-Toe-With-AI
Tic Tac Toe with AI using the Minimax algorithm. This was written in R for a final project in a college course.

## Running
I suggest using [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to run the program.

## Minimax
The [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#In_general_games) is a recursive algorithm used to
make decisions that lead to maximize the minimum "cost/score" according to some heuristic/evaluation function.

The `minimax` function is defined and implemented on line 183. You can modify the `depth` of the algorithm to make the AI 
smarter. The higher the depth the further into the game the AI will look before making a decision. You can modify the depth on 
line 171.

Have fun!
